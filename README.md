# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## Features

- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

## Installation

To install React, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react
```

or

```bash
yarn add react
```

## Getting Started

To create a new React application, you can use Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your new React application in the browser.
